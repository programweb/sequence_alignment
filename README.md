## Multiple Sequence Alignment


I obtained genomes for the ebola project

We can see the downloaded file contains 249 full length genomes. 
First, just align the first ten full ebola sequences against one another. 
Then find the IDs of the first ten sequences.
Using these accession numbers we can extract the sequences that correspond to these IDs.

I perform a **multiple sequence alignment** with the mafft tool.

I can view the alignment with the head/tail commands which display a visual alignment of all sequences.
One can see that one difference between the genomes is how complete the assemblies are at their edges.
The * character indicates a consensus.

Can perform multiple sequence alignments on 10% of the genomes
